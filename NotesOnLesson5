Notes:
HTML: 
- A way of marking up text to indicate that some text is differnt than other text
- We "tag" portions of the text to communicate meaning 
    <p>You can add a style like
    <strong>bold</strong> to some text by enclosing it in the <em>
    appropriate </em>tag.</p>
    *You can add a style like bold to some text by enclosing it in the appropriate tag.  
The Web is Still Evolving: 
- Invented in early 1990's 
- Popular in 1994
Rober Cailliau - coFounder of the World- Wide-Web

The Good Old Days, things was easy because not too much editing and making organize

World-Wide-Web Consortium 
- Formed by Tim Berners-Lee of MIT (formerly CERN)
- Founded to develop standards around HTML, CSS, XML, etc
- Insure that the web was based on open standards rather than proprietary vendor products - a bit like cat herding.

Tags rules:
- Tags must be lower-case
- Attribures must be enclosed in quotes
- Tags must be closed

Special File Names
- When a URL points to a directory in your web server, it looks for a file with a special name:Index.html, index.htm, index.php, etc
- While there is a convention, the "default file" is configurable - so nothing is "sure"
- Usually index.htm or index.html is a safe bet
- This only works when viewing through a web server - when viewing from disk, you must view the file. 

Tags have a beginning and /end
Less than = &lt;
Greater than = &gt;
& = &amp;
Comment = <!-- blah blah -->

HTML Links 
- One of the key things about HTML is making a set of pages and making "hypertext" links amongst those pages
- Links are what make the "web" a "web" - it is a web of interlinked documents.
-The Interlinked nature of te web leads to the "knowledge" the search engines like Google appear to have "intelligence"

Tables: <tbody>, <th>, <tr>, <td>

image link = src="link"
sentence link = href="link"
