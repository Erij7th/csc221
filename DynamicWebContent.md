Video 1:
Getting Data from the Server:
1. Each time the user clicks on an anchor tag with an href = value to switch to a new page, the browser makes a connection to the web server and issues a "GET" request - to GET the content of the page at specified URL. 
2. The server returns the HTML document to the browser, which formats and displays the document to the user.
3. A socket connection can be viewed as the way the brower app and web server are communcating. 

Video 2:
1. HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the protocol that browsers used to talk to servers.
2. HTTP was introduced in 1990.
3. Uniform Resources Locator can be split in three parts, protocol(example:http://), host(example:data.pr4e.org), and document(example: page1.htm).
4. Before HTTP protocol, which is before 1990, there were a lot of protocols.
5. As engineers, we need to question everything and not be satisfy with our designs.
6. The standards for all of the internet protocols(inner workings) are developed by an organization.
7. Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF)
8. www.ietf.org
9. Standards are called "RFCs"- "Request for Comments" 
Making an HTTP Request:
1. Connect to the server like data.pr4e.org
2. - a "handshake"
3. Request a document
